### **My Story**
My name is Bailey Belisario! I am a Christian, a hacker, and a student. I am currently at Dakota State University pursuing my M.S. in Computer Science. I'm relatively new to the information security community as I have only been in the field for 3 years now, but what a journey it has been so far!

I grew up in Cartersville, GA, United States. From a young age, I had a strong sense of patriotism enstilled in me by my father. He served in the Navy when he was younger and soon enough that led me to want to join the military as well once I graduated high school. I applied to the US Naval and Air Force academies, some of the best schools in the nation. It was through this process that I learned of cybersecurity. From then on, I knew that I wanted to major in Cyber Operations and use it to protect the United States in some way.

Nearing the end of my senior year of high school, it came time to learn of my acceptance and denial from universities that I applied to. Unfortunately, I was not accepted into the military academies like I had hoped for, but I still had hope that God would show me where to go. After a bit of research and help from my mother, whom I thank for bearing with me during this time, we stumbled across the [NSA's Centers of Academic Excellence in Cyber Operations](https://www.nsa.gov/resources/students-educators/centers-academic-excellence/cae-co-centers/).
